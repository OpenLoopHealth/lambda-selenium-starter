# Examples

This folder contains some *real* functions that have been creating using the Lambda Selenium Starter. Because some of the data collected with these scrapers contained sensitive information, the site info and credentials have been redacted.

Each example folder contains (and models the `src` folder):

- `lambda_function.py`
- `requirements.txt`

Feel free to explore the examples for inspiration and/or to understand what a full scale project might look like!
